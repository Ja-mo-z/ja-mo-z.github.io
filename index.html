                        October 2022 - May 2023
                        Presenting the Mission Control Center implemented by Aileen Ji, Jamie Zhou, Atul Gera, Izzy
                        Donoghue, and Rushil Saha.

                        The Mission Control Center was created for the NASA SUITS challenge. It is a website that
                        displays astronaut vitals,
                        location of astronauts and landmarks, communication, and navigation. It is built with React.js
                        on the frontend, and
                        Node.js/Websocket on the backend, receiving telemetry stream from two Microsoft HoloLens.

                    An Interpretation of Room 1695 of the Bob and Betty Beyster Building
                </h3>

                    September 11th, 2023 - October 2nd, 2023
                    Presenting a Virtual Reality project created by Jamie Zhou and Sohavni Singh.

                    We simulated a room in the Bob and Betty Beyster Building, adding objects, materials, and
                    interactions that one may find a likeness to in the real room. During the process, we improved our
                    understanding of VR interactions
                    and learned to prioritize tasks by completing a large project in small chunks.

                    Technologies utilized in the making of the project:
                    Unreal Engine 5: Game Development Engine, with ability to insert 3D objects (I used Sketchfab) and
                    audio (freesound.org)
                    as components of the game.
                    Blueprints: easily add changes to functionality onto multiple existing objects of the same Blueprint
                    Class type.
                    Materials/Textures
                    Modeling Mode: customizing 3D objects
                    Jira: team project management tool, used to asynchronous track task updates and completion with my
                    project partner.

                <ul>
                    <li>Blocked out basic area structure, then added more detailed materials, textures, and assets</li>
                    <li>Created blueprint affordance for exiting the game (line trace and trigger at door)</li>
                    <li>Added animation to passerby 3d model (walking duck)</li>
                    <li>Implemented whiteboard interaction</li>
                    <li>Created affordance such that when user interacts with wall fliers, URL opens in browser</li>
                    <li>When user interacts with objects, a day-night progression cycles</li>
                    <li>When user has debugged, transports pawn outside to see fireworks</li>

                </ul>

                <p class="project-additional-info">
                    Our custom objects are giant ducks, and two buttons that kickstart two different events. The first
                    event occurs when the
                    user interacts with the “Yes” button. In that case, the player is teleported outside of the room, as
                    fireworks set off.
                    Outside, the player not only gets to enjoy the fresh air that they have been so deprived of as a CS
                    student, but also
                    bewitch themselves with a beautiful firework spectacle, which they may prolong by interacting with
                    the giant rubber
                    ducks. They are finally finished with their EECS project, having successfully debugged and escaped
                    the prison of their
                    own doing (AKA bad code).

                    The second event occurs when the user interacts with the “No” button. In this case, all the all the
                    actors of the BBB
                    get destroyed (they have not debugged to a satisfactory extent yet!!!). Ducks come falling in from
                    the sky like the
                    apocalypse, and there’s fire everywhere. The student then is left to regret their decision to press
                    No, as they now have
                    to finish their EECS project both without computers, and with too many debugging ducks.
